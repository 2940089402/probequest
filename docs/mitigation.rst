Once installed, the **Privacy protection** option should be switched on.

iOS
---

A `new feature`_ has been introduced with iOS 8 to mitigate the privacy issues related to Wi-Fi scanning:

  "When iOS 8 devices look for a connection, they randomize that address, effectively disguising any trace of the real device until it decides to connect to a network."
